						Inwardly, contending with my self can be difficult. I thrive in
						progress and stagnate in idleness. Succinctly, I am healthiest
						when I can operate at the edge of my capabilities, pushing myself
						to learn, commit, do and achieve more. The downside is that I give
						myself over to my work so completely at points that I have to
						literally <i>mentally-nudge</i> myself to back off the throttle
						enough to enjoy the fruits of those labors.
