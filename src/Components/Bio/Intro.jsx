				Overview
				<div className='weakness'>
					I began truly developing with libraries and frameworks beginning in 2018, although I was language proficient in JavaScript well beforehand--as I wrote a lot of scripts to add functionality to spreadsheets in past. I have worked on numerous projects this year and I plan on working
					as a freelance developer for some duration as well as dabbling in other modern JS frameworks.

				<div className='weakness'>
					I have listed out the more prominent technologies I am efficient in the last section of this webpage.

				<div className='weakness'>
					I am always excited by challenges and continually try to learn new ways of doing things because it adds to my ability of being able to approach issues from different perspectives and tackle problems at different angles. I still have a lot to learn but that is what this journey is
					about.
