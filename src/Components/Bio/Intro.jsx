				About Me
				<div className='weakness'>
				
						I began truly developing in the beginning of 2019, although I was language
						proficient in JavaScript and Python well beforehand as I wrote a lot of
						scripts to add functionality to spreadsheets in past. Beginning this year
						(2020) I plan on building out larger scale projects, beyond simple demos to
						further increase my proficiency in React as well as other modern JS
						frameworks.
				
				</div>
				<div className='weakness'>
				
						I am Ecma Script 6 & 7 efficient on the Javascript side of things. I use
						current practices in React (and React-Native) such as Hooks, useContext,
						useReducer, etc. I am efficient in Redux and its middleware's Thunk and
						Persist, Firebase, Node & Express. I am always excited by challenges and
						continually try to learn new ways of doing things because it adds to my
						ability of being able to approach issues from different perspectives and
						tackle problems at different angles. I still have a lot to learn but that is
						what this journey is about.
