				About Me
				<p className='weakness'>
					<q>
						I am honing my skills to become a professional mid-level
						developer. I believe that I am a strong candidate for any Junior
						level position. I am Ecma Script 6 & 7 efficient on the Javascript
						side of things and I use all current practices in React such as
						Hooks, useContext, useReducer, etc. I am always excited by
						challenges and continually try to learn new ways of doing things
						because it adds to my ability of being able to approach issues
						from different perspectives and tackle problems at different
						angles. I still have a lot to learn but that is what this journey
						is about.
